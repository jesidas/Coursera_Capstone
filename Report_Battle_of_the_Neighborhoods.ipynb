The main metropolitan entry point for immigrants into the United States of America is New York. The ethnic diversity of New York City brings a diverse range of restaurants. These restaurants include cuisines like Chinese, Italian, Indian, and more. America has a large Indian population, as does New York City. With this comes a number of Indian restaurants in New York City. This project will explore the presence of Indian cusisine in New York City neighborhoods.\n\nIn particular, the following questions will be answered:\n1. Which areas have a lot of Indian restaurants?\n2. What is the best location in New York City for Indian restaurants?\n3. Which areas potentially have an Indian cuisine market?\n4. Which area needs more Indian restaurants?\n5. What neighborhood is best suited for Indian people to live with places to operate Indian restaurants?"
